# ML4DQMPODASExercise
A repository to host the Tracker DQM ML exercise for CMS PO DAS.

### Exercise 1 (`exercise1.ipynb`):
This is a tutorial covering the following topics:
- Where to find input data suitable for DQM/DC machine learning studies and how to read and prepare it.
- How to train and evaluate an autoencoder model to spot anomalous lumisections.

Information on how to run the tutorial (installation, prerequisites, etc.) is given in the notebook itself.  
While this tutorial is focused on the pixel tracker, many of the concepts and practical procedures are applicable to other subsystems as well.
