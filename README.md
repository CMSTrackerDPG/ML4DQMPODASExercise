# ML4DQM PODAS Exercise
A repository to host the Tracker DQM ML exercise for CMS PO DAS.

### Exercise 1 (`exercise1.ipynb`):
This is a tutorial covering the following topics:
- Where to find input data suitable for DQM/DC machine learning studies and how to read and prepare it.
- How to train and evaluate an autoencoder model to spot anomalous lumisections.

Information on how to run the tutorial (installation, prerequisites, etc.) is given in the notebook itself.

Note: this is the version of the exercise compatible with SWAN (lxplus) at CERN. It will not work on the DESY NAF system because of different installed python modules and paths to input files. For the fully PODAS compatible version, see the `desy-podas` branch [here](https://github.com/CMSTrackerDPG/ML4DQMPODASExercise/tree/desy-podas).
